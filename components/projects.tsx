      detailedDescription:
        "Analyzed narrative structure's effect on book popularity across 25,000 books, using Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) and book-level measures like skewness, kurtosis, and sentiment volatility to assess reader engagement. Identified key predictors of book downloads by implementing OLS and LASSO regression models, providing data-driven insights for authors and publishers on factors influencing reader preferences.",
