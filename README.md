ðŸ§  Reflection
Working with V0.dev was both exciting and insightful. I loved how quickly I could turn my ideas into a functioning React-based portfolio using Tailwind CSS and ShadCN components. One of the most valuable lessons was learning to write clear, specific prompts â€” vague ones often produced unexpected layouts, which was a challenge at first. I also struggled initially with component breakdown and figuring out how to iterate meaningfully without overcomplicating the structure. However, as I practiced, I became more comfortable prompting the AI to make design improvements like layout responsiveness and interactive effects. Breaking the layout into reusable components helped me understand the power of modular code, and overall, this experience made me more confident in bridging design and development with modern tools.
